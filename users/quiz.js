"use strict"

var animals = ["dog", "cat", "rabbit"];
you would stringify this to send it to another computer
{
  "city": "New York",
  "population": 8419000
}
you would parse this to make it easier to work with in JS
easier means you can use dot notation on objects easier means you can loop through an array and use indexes etc..

var book = {
  title: "1984",
  author: "George Orwell",
  isFiction: true
};
